# DelaunayTriangulation
Delaunay Triangle Calculation with given .tri files using OpenMP
# Documentation
Please check github.pdf file for more information. Classes in the code are well documented and could be used as a library to represent vertices, triangles and additional functions related to the nature of their geometry.
# NOT COMPLETE
Although it seems that the program is complete it still needs work such as implementing the creation of the triangles and edge detection.
